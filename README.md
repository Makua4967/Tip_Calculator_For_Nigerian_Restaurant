# Tip_Calculator_For_Nigerian_Restaurant
This is my second project. Originally, the aim of this project was to solve a minute challange associated with payments and tipping at Nigerian restaurants and hotels or even local eateries. This program calculates the tip a person or several persons will pay for a meal or any service generally with regard to the total bill and the tip percentage. I utilized my knowledge of the follow basic python functions to write this program.:
## Maths 
## Data types 
## Type conversion 
## String manipulation 
## Fstrings
